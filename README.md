# Vocal Clues Unveiled - Gender from Voice Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the gender (male or female) from voice recordings using machine learning techniques. The goal is to train models that can accurately classify the gender based on various voice attributes.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to voice recordings. These attributes are used as features to train the machine learning models.

## Models
Two machine learning models are used in this project:
1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
2. Random Forest Classifier

These models are trained on the voice data to predict the gender of the speaker.

## Usage
- **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and preprocess it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Use the provided Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to train the SVC and Random Forest models on the voice data.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models' performance on the test data.
- **Model Saving**: Save the trained models using pickle for future use.

## Results
The project aims to achieve high accuracy in predicting the gender of the speaker based on voice attributes. The models' performance will be evaluated and compared to determine the best approach.
